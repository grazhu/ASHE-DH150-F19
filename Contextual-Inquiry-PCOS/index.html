Project Description <br><br>

Step 1: Design Challenge <br> 
The main activity my project would support would be to provide a community for people diagnosed with PCOS through a recipe sharing app. Maintaining a healthy diet is one of the most direct approaches to mitigating PCOS symptoms and taking care of your health. A platform directed for people who are diagnosed with PCOS know someone who is experiencing PCOS symptoms will be able to facilitate a sense of community. The basic need involved is the most basic physiological need because you are taking care of your body and health. <br> <br>
	There currently exist several recipe sharing apps and there are several apps that help you track your PCOS symptoms and learn more about what you can do to treat it but I believe that a recipe sharing app targeted for the PCOS community will be able to satisfy a combination of needs. It is filling a space where people feel disconnected and connects them with other people who are going through similar experiences while also providing an easy, tangible, and applicable solution to their health goals. Digital technology enables users from far distances away to connect and share their experiences and recipes that they feel good eating and help them feel better in regards to their PCOS. <br><br><br>


Step 2: Target Users <br> 
	Target users will primarily be women because PCOS affects women the most. Because PCOS is a chronic condition that can affect women starting from puberty, this app will be accessible by a wide range of age groups. PCOS may occur more commonly with certain ethnicities, but this app will focus on women of all ethnicities. <br><br>
Users will generally use this app at home when they are cooking a meal and want to find some inspiration. They may also use it during in public spaces like grocery stores, restaurants, and lunch break rooms because those areas are all centered around food and might spark some inspiration or desire for certain recipes. Users would open the app and select what kind of meal category they would like to browse through and then look though recipes posted by other users. They may be able to message others users to connect with them or even post their own recipes to share with the community.

Step 3: Research Method <br> 

I will be interviewing a target user. <br> 
<br> <br> 

Step 4: Observation and Context <br> 
	I will conduct the interview with a target user who has PCOS. I will conduct the interview in her living space and ask her a series of prepared questions about her experience with PCOS. I will ask her questions to understand her feelings and emotions about her diagnosis process, what she is doing to treat any symptoms, how she is doing those, and effective means of support. I will inform her that this will be a casual discussion and that if she feels uncomfortable with sharing any aspect of her experience that she may refrain from doing so. I will be voice recording (with her consent) our session and then type up her responses in a structured script so that I can be fully engaged in the conversation and active in asking her leading and following up questions.

Final Analysis <br>
I think that my session with my target user went very well and I was able to learn a lot about her personal experience with PCOS and what frusturations exist for her. I was glad that she felt comfortable opening up to the questions that I asked her, even though they become pretty personal. I don't think I pressured her or crossed any innappropriate boundaries, but I think for the future, I may have to think about the line of professionalism when asking more personal questions because I had known her previously but if I were to conduct the interview with an unfamiliar person, the conversation dynamics would differ. I also think next time I can work on asking unbiased questions so that I do not skew or alter their answers, and coming up with a larger bank of different questions so that I can avoid asking similar questions.
