Introduction <br>
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Awareness Association (PCOSAA) aims to raise awareness about PCOS and help provide support by providing resources to find a PCOS specialist, online forums, events, and volunteer opportunities to get involved. <br>

Rationale of UT and Usability Issues of Website<br>
A usability test is used to understand how effective an interface is at enabling a user to complete and achieve desired tasks. With a moderator, a user will be recorded while completing a series of tasks using the interface. Video and data analysis are required afterward to identify what went well, and areas of improvement. A usability test will be able to detect key sore points in the user’s experience with the website and also provide more information about what possible solutions might be most effective. <br>
From a personal heuristic evaluation, the PCOSAA website does not effectively communicate its goal or information effectively. The navigating tabs on the top of the screen are difficult to read and do not provide enough visual contrast against the white background screen for the user. As well, information is confusingly organized and makes it difficult for the user to navigate the site to find both information that they are looking and for important information that they should know about. The banner on the main page is not as informative and impactful as it can be. Key points like contact information for the organization is difficult to find. The lack of a search bar can be frustrating for users who want to efficiently look for something on the website. Having the option to do the same task in multiple areas of the website is confusing and may lead the user to believe that they are different services. <br>
<br><br>

Purpose of UT <br>
The purpose of the usability testing is to find out how to improve the website from the user’s perspective. Conducting the test on actual potential users will increase the chances that the problems they encounter will reflect the user experiences of others. <br>

<br><br>
Setting of Study <br>
The usability test will be conducted in a casual but private room in Los Angeles, California, near UCLA on November 2, 2019. We will be using a personal laptop to facilitate the entire test. We will also be using Apowersoft to screen and webcam record the entire session, conducted through Forms on Google Suite. <br>

<br><br>
Note: This will be a pilot test to test the setting and the materials <br>

<br><br>
Process<br>
During the session, the moderator explained the task and asked a few background questions regarding their experience with the website, and some pre test questions about how easy or difficult the website looks to use. The participant was then asked to perform a series of tasks utilizing various functions and features on the website. If a participant was able to complete the task, it was checked off. Afterwards, there were two post test questionnaires. The first one asked how easy or difficult it was to complete the task, how much time they think it took to complete the task, and how likely they would do the task. The second questionnaire asked the participant to rate the website on a scale of “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree” on 10 different subjective measures. Those included: <br><br>
-	Frequency of use <br>
-	Website complexity <br>
-	Ease of use <br>
-	Required technician support <br>
-	Function integration of website <br>
-	Inconsistency <br>
-	Ease/quick to learn <br>
-	Cumbersome to use <br>
-	Confidence using the website <br>
-	Need to learn a lot of things before using the website <br>
The participant was then given a product satisfaction card, asking them to select 5 adjectives that best reflect their perception of the website. The last page is gathering demographic information about the participant. We choose to place this at the end to prevent any bias from influencing our participant’s answers. <br>

Reflection<br>
  I learned the importance of having a pilot test before you run your experiment. No matter how prepared and how many time you go over your test materials, something will come up that you did not think of before. I learned that the to the participant, they understand and only perceive the bigger picture of what is going on, but to the moderator, everything is in the details. I also learned to be prepared for any sort of questions that the participant may have and to be able to explain any confusion and correct my mistakes on the spot. <br>
  I think the overall test went well. Minor issues like mistakes on my google form did not seem to affect my participant’s experience performing the tasks. It took some time to set up the screen recording so I will practice that more for next time. Additionally, someone came into the room during the middle of our test so I will make sure to put up a “Please do not disturb” sign. I will also include a portion to include comments for the post-test questionnaire, and ask directly for feedback because I noticed that although my participant answered that the website was easy to use, when I was talking to her afterwards, she mentioned key points about how it was actually kind of difficult to perform some tasks. <br>
