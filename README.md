Overall Evaluation

The current website has a lot of valuable information that visitors can greatly benefit from. A redesign may prompt increased engagement and knowledge on the different kids of services and resources is available to those who suffer or know someone who suffers from PCOS. The website is ineffective at highlighting the key points of the design/organization the website hinders the user from navigating effectively through the different pages on the website. Key information is not immediately available and visible to the user.
