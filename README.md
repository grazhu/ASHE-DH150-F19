Redesigning the ASHE Page 

Student Name: Grace Zhu
Course: DH150 

Brief Descrition

This website is the main website for the [Arthur Ashe Student Health & Wellness Center](http://www.studenthealth.ucla.edu/default.aspx) at UCLA. It provides a holistic overview of the services and resources that students have acccess to. 

Overall Evaluation

The current website has a lot of valuable information that students can greatly benefit from. A redesign may prompt increased engagement and knowledge on the different kids of services and resources that students have access to. The website is currently cramped with information that is just pasted onto the front page, making it hard for the user to navigate, find, and access information effectively and efficiently. The main sign in link is obscured, and the abundance of notices are unorganized.
