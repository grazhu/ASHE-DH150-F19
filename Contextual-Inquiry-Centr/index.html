Step 1 <br> 
The main activity that Centr would support would be to provide a workout and meal plan for users looking for a healthier lifestyle. It provides a customizable program, tracks your progress, shares news information, and even has a shopping list feature. <br> 
Building a healthier lifestyle fulfilled the physiological need because we first and foremost need to be physically healthy to support the lifestyle that we want. Centr can also indirectly support safety and esteem because a healthier body means less risk for diseases and can promote both a healthier mindset and self image. <br> 
The traditional and current solutions involve hiring a personal trainer to help guide and teach you how to work out properly. Online websites are also a source of information, as well as going into your local gym and talking to other people there and learning from them. The limitations of these options is that personal trainers are often very expensive and require long term assistance so this may not be a sustainable option for many people. There are so many news outlets and sources of information online that it seems overwhelming trying to figure out what workout routine and diet is best for you and where you should get started. Lastly, it may be intimidating to approach experienced people at the gym when you are first starting out, especially when they are busy and preoccupied in focusing on their own workout routine.

Step 2 <br> 
	The characteristic of users are young to middle aged people (men and women) who are looking to achieve a healthier lifestyle and are looking for a source of guidance or inspiration. The app is customizable based on your preferences and expertise so it is widely accessible. Further, the app is co-created by a famous actor, Chris Hemsworth, so users may also be avid followers and fans who are looking to achieve his fitness goals or are inspired by him. <br> 
	Users have a wide range of options to use this app because it is so customizable and adaptable to different lifestyles and preferences. Users can use the app at any space that is appropriate and conducive to a lots of movement and activity, such as at home, at the gym, or even outside at a beach or park. To actually use the app, the user will first have to create a profile and input some personal information and general goals that they want to achieve. Then the program is customized and provides options for you to choose from. There are different meal plans and work out routines to follow, as well as a calendar to keep track of your progress. <br>

Step 3<br> 

	I will both interview with direct users as well as observe the social behaviour of people working out at the John Wooden gym.<br> 

Step 4<br> 
	The John Wooden gym is very bright and colourful with lots of equipment available for people to work out. I went in the late afternoon so while it wasnâ€™t super busy, there were still a good number of people working out. 
I noticed that most people were working out alone and some were working in pairs. Those who were working out alone always had earphones in and were tuned into their own workout routine and did not interact much with other people until they were done with their entire routine. They would go on their phones in between sets to rest before starting the next exercise. Those who were in pairs were much more interactive and took turns working out and spotting the other person. Most conversations seems to be light hearted and I noticed that pairs used their phones less and did not have earphones plugged in. <br> 
	I noticed that in general, individuals and groups tend to stay in one area of the gym for periods at a time and only move if they are finished with a piece of equipment. Further, I noticed that there was a wide range of people at the gym: students, older adults, men, women, and people of different fitness levels. I could not tell what their workout routine was, but I noticed a variety of activities: some only stayed at the weight areas, others only at cardio, some alternated between the two, and others worked out doing body weight exercises on mats. <br>
